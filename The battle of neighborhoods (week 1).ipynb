For instance, let's think that a FourSquare user had to move from New York city, USA to the city of Toronto, Canada. FourSquare location data along with a clustering algorithm can suggest a neighborhood in order to help this user to live in Toronto in a similar place. The neighborhood that will be sugested, will not be a random suggestion, but instead will be a place for his pleasure. Thus, previous data from New York and Toronto will be used to predict a good living neighborhood for him."
